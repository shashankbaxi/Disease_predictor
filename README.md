```markdown
# Disease Predictor

Disease Predictor is a web application built using Flask and Machine Learning to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on user inputs. The application uses trained machine learning models to provide accurate predictions and assist users in identifying potential health concerns.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface
- Predicts the likelihood of various diseases based on user inputs
- Utilizes trained machine learning models for accurate predictions
- Provides detailed information and advice based on predictions

## Technologies Used

- Flask: Web framework for building the application
- Scikit-learn: Library for machine learning algorithms
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- HTML/CSS: Frontend development

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/disease-predictor.git
   cd disease-predictor
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the application.

## Usage

1. Enter the required inputs on the web interface.
2. Click on the "Predict" button.
3. The application will display the predicted likelihood of various diseases based on the inputs provided.

## Machine Learning Model

The machine learning model used in this project is trained on a dataset containing various health-related features and disease outcomes. The model is built using Scikit-learn and can be easily updated with new data for improved accuracy.
